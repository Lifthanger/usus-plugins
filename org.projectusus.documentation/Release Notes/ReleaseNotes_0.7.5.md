# Usus 0.7.5 Release Notes

## New Features

Thanks to @Bananeweizen a number of pull requests have been submitted and merged. Besides a couple of UI fixes there are two major new features:

- The Usus perspective now provides the same wizard shortcuts as the Java perspective.
- Both the Class Graph and the Package Graph view now provide access to the full refactoring menu as available e.g. in the Package Explorer. This allows for moving classes into a new package straight from the Class Graph, for example.
