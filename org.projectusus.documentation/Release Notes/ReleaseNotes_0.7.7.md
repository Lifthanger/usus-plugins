# Usus 0.7.7 Release Notes

## Bug Fixes

Two bugs have been fixed:

- Usus 0.7.6 broke a number of features that involved showing specific packages/classes in the package or class graph, respectively. E.g. navigating from the Hotspots view to the Package Graph to show packages that make up a package cycle did not work anymore.
- In Usus 0.7.5 the "select classes from same package" context menu action stopped working.
