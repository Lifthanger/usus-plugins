# Usus 0.7.6 Release Notes

## New Features

Classes shown in the Usus Class Graph view can now be filtered by source folder. All source folders of Usus-enabled Java projects are collected and grouped by name. There's a new toggle action in the view's toolbar that allows to select visible source folders. This allows to filter out generated code or test code, for example.
