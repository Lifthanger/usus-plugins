# Usus 0.8.0 Release Notes

## New Features

The dependency graphs now detect relations that are based on Java 8 language features such as method references and lambda expressions. Please see https://github.com/usus/usus-plugins/issues/55 for a more detailed explanation. 

As a ramification the runtime requirements of Eclipse have changed: You require Eclipse 4.4 (Luna) or newer to install Project Usus. The same holds if you are developing and contributing to Usus.
